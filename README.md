# This project is inspired by [wordle](www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [sutom](https://sutom.nocle.fr/#)
This game was made as an introduction for me to React.

## Welcome to frenchWordle. 
The goal of the game is to guess the `word of the day` by trial and error.
When you enter a word, letters that are contained in the `word of the day` but aren't correctly placed are shown in yellow. Letters that are in the correct place are shown in green.

Once you have have guessed the `word of the day` you can compare the number of tries and the time it took you with everyone else in the scoreboard.
